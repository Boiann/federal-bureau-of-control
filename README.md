# FEDERAL BUREAU OF CONTROL

FEDERAL BUREAU OF CONTROL is a Project 4 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: Full-Stack Toolkit. Made with passion for anyone interested in Control, a game by Remedy Entertainment Plc. Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) is a part of the game narrative and much of the game lore & events are presented through FBC documents found in-game. This Project was an attempt to bring the FBC to life, and imagine how it would look like in real life.

## **Project Overview**

The idea for the project was concieved when brainstorming about what can be made that is like a blog, but not an actual blog. After finding the inspiration in FBC, the wireframes and flowcharts were developed, keeping Agile methodology in mind.
Using mainly Django, a Python back-end development framework and Bootstrap, front-end (CSS) framework, this project was brought to life.
The idea was to develop a website representing secretive fictional government. This meant there is little to none of the kind expressions (please, thank you) and the instructions/messages for the user are serious and to the point (warning modals). This does not take away from ux in general, everything is made to run smoothly and without errors with intuitive website navigation.
The admin (Director) has the power to view, approve/deny, delete and modify user reports and comments (CRUD). Additionaly. the admin can censor any text from the Django admin page.
The user can add/modify/delete and view their own report of strange/unusual/paranatural event (CRUD), submit comments to any report and approve or deny reports (like/dislike). The user is taking on a role of an Agent of the FBC while registered/logged in on the website, and the admin is the Director. 
Adding all of these things together (and much more) will hopefuly give any user an rewarding and exciting experience, letting them immerse themselves in Control fiction.
